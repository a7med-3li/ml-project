# Notes:
# - This list was produced by scanning the project's scripts and notebooks (excluding
#   the `myenv` virtual environment and image asset files and image assets).
# - Jupyter / notebook-related packages (e.g., jupyterlab, notebook, ipython) are
#   intentionally omitted here; install them separately if you run notebooks interactively.
# - For exact reproducibility, create a full pinned freeze inside the project's virtualenv:
#     pip freeze > requirements.txt
