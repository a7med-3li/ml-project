"""scripts/prepare_image_dataset.py

Placeholder for code that inspects and prepares the YOLO-style image dataset found in `image_dataset/`.

Responsibilities (when implemented):
- Walk the dataset directory structure (train/val/test)
- Validate that images have corresponding label files
- Optionally create a CSV manifest or reformat labels

Currently this file is a placeholder with usage notes.
